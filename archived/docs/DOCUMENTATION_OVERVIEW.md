# üìö Documentation Overview

> *A guide to navigating the comprehensive documentation suite for the Auto Futures Trading Machine*

## üéØ Purpose

This documentation suite serves as both a **technical reference** and a **learning resource**. It tells the story of how we evolved from a monolithic Python script to a distributed, event-driven trading system that borrows concepts from high-frequency trading while remaining accessible to Python developers.

## üìù Key Documents Explained

### The Refactoring Story
A narrative journey showing how we transformed a 155-line monolithic `app.py` into a clean, testable architecture. Perfect for understanding the value of good architecture.

### Why ZeroMQ?
Technical deep-dive into our messaging layer choice. Covers PUB/SUB, PUSH/PULL, and REQ/REP patterns with performance benchmarks.

### Migration Journey
A developer's personal account of the refactoring process, complete with "aha!" moments and lessons learned.

### HFT Concepts
Explains what we borrowed from high-frequency trading and, importantly, what we didn't. Shows how HFT principles can benefit any trading system.

### Roadmap
Complete project timeline from inception to future plans, including metrics and success criteria.

## üåü Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows these principles:

1. **Tell Stories**: Technical concepts are easier to understand through narrative
2. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Code examples and diagrams throughout
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Same concepts explained different ways
4. **Real-World Focus**: Based on actual development experiences
5. **Continuous Evolution**: Documentation grows with the project
