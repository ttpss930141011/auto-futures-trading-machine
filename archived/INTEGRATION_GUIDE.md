# Auto Futures Trading Machine - Complete User Guide

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

**Nothing has changed for you as a user!** The system is now more secure and reliable, but your workflow remains exactly the same:

```bash
python app.py
# Use menu options 1, 3, 4, 5 as usual
# Then use option 10 (AllInOneController) to start everything
```

## What's New

### Enhanced Security & Reliability
Your system now uses an **optimized DLL Gateway Architecture** that:
- ✅ Eliminates security vulnerabilities from credential files
- ✅ Prevents duplicate events and trading conflicts  
- ✅ Provides centralized logging and monitoring
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Uses consistent API patterns for reliable order execution
- ✅ Unified data structures reduce complexity and errors

### Improved Status Messages
When you start the application, you'll now see:
```
Initializing Auto Futures Trading Machine with DLL Gateway...
✓ DLL Gateway Server: Running on tcp://127.0.0.1:5557
✓ Exchange API: Centralized access through gateway
✓ Multi-process support: Enhanced security and stability
```

## Complete Workflow Guide

### 1. Initial Setup (One-time)

#### Environment Configuration (Optional)
If you need custom ports or timeouts, create a `.env` file:
```bash
# Copy the example (optional)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit if needed (most users don't need this)
nano .env
```

### 2. Daily Trading Workflow

#### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

You should see the Gateway initialization messages, then the familiar menu.

#### Step 2: Basic Setup (Same as Before)
```
=== Auto Futures Trading Machine ===
1. User Login
2. User Logout
3. Register Item
4. Create Condition
5. Select Order Account
6. Send Market Order
7. Show Futures
8. Get Position
10. All-in-One Controller
0. Exit

Choose an option: 1
```

Complete these steps in order:
1. **Option 1**: Login with your credentials
2. **Option 3**: Register the futures contract you want to trade
3. **Option 4**: Create your trading conditions/strategy
4. **Option 5**: Select your trading account

#### Step 3: Start Trading System
```
Choose an option: 10
```

The AllInOneController will now start:
- ✅ Gateway thread (market data)
- ✅ Strategy process (signal generation)  
- ✅ Order Executor process (order execution)

You'll see output like:
```
=== Starting All Trading System Components ===

Starting Gateway thread...
Waiting for Gateway to initialize...

Starting Strategy process...

Starting Order Executor process...

=== System Startup Results ===
Prerequisites check: ✓
Gateway: ✓
Strategy: ✓
Order Executor: ✓
=============================

All system components have been started.
You can continue using the main menu. The processes will run in the background.
The system will automatically clean up when you exit the application.
```

#### Step 4: Monitor and Manage
The system is now running! You can:
- Continue using other menu options
- Monitor the background processes
- Use Ctrl+C to stop everything cleanly

### 3. Advanced Usage

#### Manual Process Control
If you need fine-grained control, you can start processes individually:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main application with gateway
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Order executor only
python run_order_executor_gateway.py

# Terminal 3: Strategy only  
python run_strategy.py
```

#### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Test gateway connectivity
python test_gateway_integration.py
```

#### Custom Configuration
Edit `.env` file for custom settings:
```bash
# Custom ports
DLL_GATEWAY_PORT=6557
ZMQ_SIGNAL_PORT=6556

# Performance tuning
DLL_GATEWAY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
DLL_GATEWAY_RETRY_COUNT=5
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Solutions

#### "Gateway is not accessible"
1. Check that `python app.py` shows Gateway started message
2. Verify no port conflicts: `netstat -an | grep 5557`
3. Check firewall settings for localhost traffic

#### "Order Executor failed to start"
1. Ensure you've logged in (option 1) first
2. Complete item registration (option 3) and account selection (option 5)
3. Check system logs for detailed error messages

#### Performance Issues
1. Check system resources (CPU, memory)
2. Increase timeout values in `.env` file
3. Verify network connectivity to exchange

### Getting Help

#### Log Analysis
The system provides detailed logging. Check for:
- Gateway connection status
- Process startup messages
- Order execution results
- Error messages with specific codes

#### Configuration Validation
```bash
# Test your configuration
python test_gateway_integration.py
```

#### Support Resources
1. Check `README_GATEWAY.md` for technical details
2. Review `docs/decisions/004-dll-gateway-centralization.md` for architecture
3. Examine test files for usage examples

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions
- No workflow changes required
- All existing strategies and conditions work unchanged
- Configuration is backward compatible
- Enhanced security is automatic

### File Changes
- **Main application**: Enhanced `app.py` (no separate gateway file)
- **Order executor**: Now uses `run_order_executor_gateway.py` exclusively
  - ⚠️ `run_order_executor.py` has been removed (deprecated old architecture)
- **Configuration**: Added `.env` support for customization
- **API consistency**: Unified DTO usage across all Gateway components

## Performance Characteristics

### Typical Performance
- Gateway response time: <1ms
- Order execution path: <50ms total
- Memory usage: ~10MB per process
- CPU usage: <1% under normal load

### Scalability
- Handles multiple concurrent orders
- Automatic retry and recovery
- Process isolation for fault tolerance
- Resource-efficient design

## Security Features

### Enhanced Protection
- **Credential Security**: No plaintext storage in child processes
- **Access Control**: Only main process has exchange API access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all trading operations
- **Process Isolation**: Maintains fault tolerance benefits

### Best Practices
1. Keep credentials secure in main application only
2. Monitor log files for unusual activity
3. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
4. Regular system health checks

## Technical Architecture

### Component Overview
```
Main Process (app.py)
├── DLL Gateway Server (port 5557)
├── Exchange DLL (single instance)
├── User Interface (CLI menu)
└── Process Management

Child Processes
├── Strategy Process
│   ├── Market Data Subscriber
│   └── Signal Publisher
└── Order Executor Process
    ├── Signal Subscriber
    └── Gateway Client (connects to port 5557)
```

### Communication Flow
1. **Market Data**: Exchange → Gateway → Strategy
2. **Trading Signals**: Strategy → Order Executor
3. **Order Execution**: Order Executor → Gateway → Exchange
4. **Status/Health**: All components → Centralized logging

This architecture ensures security, reliability, and performance while maintaining the familiar user experience.
