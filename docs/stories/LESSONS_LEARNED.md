# ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

> *Key takeaways from building and refactoring this trading system*

1. **Start Small, Refactor Incrementally**
   - Tackle one responsibility at a time (e.g., extract SystemManager first).
   - Keep tests green before and after each change.

2. **Tests Are Documentation**
   - Clear, focused tests explain expected behavior better than comments.
   - Aim for 95%+ coverage on critical paths.

3. **Names Matter**
   - `SystemManager` vs. `_setup_gateway()`: clarity wins.
   - Method names should reveal intent.

4. **Deletion Is Progress**
   - Removing dead code often has a greater impact than adding features.
   - Each line removed reduces cognitive load.

5. **Documentation and Diagrams Help Onboarding**
   - Diagrams of data flow (tick â†’ strategy â†’ order) make the architecture intuitive.
   - Story-based docs engage developers of all levels.

6. **Balance Simplicity and Performance**
   - ZeroMQ + msgpack provided significant speedups without over-engineering.
   - Avoid premature optimization; profile before tuning.

7. **Choose Patterns That Fit**
   - Event-driven architecture matched our need for real-time trading.
   - Clean Architecture ensured testability and separation of concerns.

8. **Configuration Should Be Centralized**
   - Environment variables kept sensitive data out of code.
   - A single `.env` file simplifies setup and prevents leaks.

9. **Resilience Through Isolation**
   - Separate processes for gateway, strategy, executor prevent cascade failures.
   - Health checks and graceful shutdown ensure stability.

10. **Keep Learning and Iterating**
    - Regularly revisit assumptions (e.g., backtests vs. live results).
    - Documentation should evolve as the code does.
