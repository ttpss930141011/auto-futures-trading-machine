## üìà Strategy Overview

This system currently has **one built-in strategy**: **Right-side Entry Support/Resistance Strategy**

### Strategy Features
- **Right-side Entry**: Don't catch falling knives, wait for price confirmation reversal before entry
- **Dynamic Tracking**: Can adjust entry points based on market movements
- **Risk Control**: Built-in take profit, stop loss, and false breakout filtering mechanisms

### Operating Principle (Buy Example)
1. **Trigger Condition**: Strategy activates when price breaks below support level (Target Price)
2. **Wait for Confirmation**: Actually buy when price rebounds to `Target Price + Turning Point`
3. **Risk Control**: Automatically set take profit (+120 points) and stop loss (-30 points)
