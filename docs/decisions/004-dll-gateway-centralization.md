# ADR-004: DLL Gateway Centralization

## Status
Implemented and Fully Integrated

## Context
The original architecture required each child process (OrderExecutor, Strategy) to initialize its own instance of the exchange DLL (PFCFApi), leading to several critical issues:

### Problems with Original Approach
1. **Security Risk**: Credentials were stored in plaintext JSON files for child processes to access
2. **Event Duplication**: Multiple DLL instances caused duplicate event emissions
3. **Resource Waste**: Multiple connections to the same exchange API
4. **State Inconsistency**: Different DLL instances could have different states
5. **Authentication Complexity**: Each process needed to perform its own authentication

### Architecture Challenges
- **Multi-process Design**: Clean separation required for fault isolation
- **DLL State Management**: Exchange DLL maintains connection state that cannot be easily shared
- **Communication Overhead**: Need for efficient IPC between processes
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and recovery

## Decision
We will implement a **DLL Gateway Service** pattern that centralizes all exchange DLL access through the main application process, with child processes communicating via ZeroMQ.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. DLL Gateway Server (Main Process)
- **Location**: `src/infrastructure/services/dll_gateway_server.py`
- **Responsibility**: Owns the single PFCFApi instance and serves requests
- **Communication**: ZeroMQ REP socket (configurable via `DLL_GATEWAY_PORT`)
- **Integration**: Automatically started in `app.py` during application initialization
- **Operations Supported**:
  - `send_order`: Execute trading orders
  - `get_positions`: Query account positions
  - `health_check`: Service health monitoring

#### 2. DLL Gateway Client (Child Processes)
- **Location**: `src/infrastructure/services/dll_gateway_client.py`
- **Responsibility**: Provides interface to communicate with gateway server
- **Communication**: ZeroMQ REQ socket (configurable via environment variables)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Connection management and recovery
  - Configurable timeout handling
  - Health check capabilities

#### 3. Interface Abstraction
- **Location**: `src/interactor/interfaces/services/dll_gateway_service_interface.py`
- **Purpose**: Dependency Inversion Principle compliance
- **Benefits**: Testability and future extensibility
- **Data Classes**: `OrderRequest`, `OrderResponse`, `PositionInfo`

#### 4. Enhanced Order Executor
- **Location**: `src/domain/order/order_executor_gateway.py`
- **Process**: `run_order_executor_gateway.py`
- **Changes**: Uses DLL Gateway Client instead of direct DLL access
- **Benefits**: Simplified initialization, no authentication required, no credential access

#### 5. Centralized Configuration
- **Location**: `src/app/cli_pfcf/config.py`
- **Environment Support**: All gateway settings configurable via `.env` file
- **Properties**: Automatic address generation from host/port settings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default values maintain original behavior

### Communication Protocol
```json
{
  "operation": "send_order",
  "parameters": {
    "order_account": "string",
    "item_code": "string",
    "side": "string",
    "order_type": "string",
    "price": 0.0,
    "quantity": 1,
    "open_close": "string",
    "note": "string",
    "day_trade": "string",
    "time_in_force": "string"
  }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Shared Memory
- **Pros**: Fastest communication
- **Cons**: Complex synchronization, platform-dependent, difficult debugging

### Alternative 2: Database-based Communication
- **Pros**: Persistent state, transaction support
- **Cons**: Higher latency, additional dependency, overkill for simple operations

### Alternative 3: File-based IPC
- **Pros**: Simple implementation
- **Cons**: File I/O overhead, synchronization issues, poor performance

### Alternative 4: HTTP REST API
- **Pros**: Standard protocol, debugging tools available
- **Cons**: Higher overhead than ZeroMQ, more complex implementation

## Implementation Details

### SOLID Principles Compliance

#### Single Responsibility Principle
- `DllGatewayServer`: Only handles DLL request/response
- `DllGatewayClient`: Only handles client communication
- `OrderExecutorGateway`: Only processes trading signals

#### Open/Closed Principle
- Interface-based design allows extension without modification
- New operations can be added to the gateway without changing clients

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
- `OrderExecutorGateway` depends on `DllGatewayServiceInterface`
- Concrete implementations can be swapped for testing

#### Interface Segregation Principle
- Focused interfaces for specific operations
- Clients only depend on methods they use

#### Liskov Substitution Principle
- Any implementation of `DllGatewayServiceInterface` can replace another

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Timeout Errors**: Configurable timeouts with clear error messages
3. **DLL Errors**: Propagated through standardized error responses
4. **Invalid Requests**: Validation before processing

### Security Improvements
1. **No Plaintext Credentials**: Child processes don't need credentials
2. **Single Authentication Point**: Only main process handles login
3. **Audit Trail**: All DLL operations logged centrally
4. **Network Security**: Communication limited to localhost
